# Playwright-Automation-Showcase
A repository to showcase the playwright framework I've built using the page object model (POM) design pattern and testing against various online demo websites, written in TypeScript using the Playwright test automation Library.

My goal is to write SOLID, DRY (where possible with test code), and CLEAN test code to make 'Uncle Bob' smile. 

But more importantly, so that the code can be easily read and extended by other QA's
