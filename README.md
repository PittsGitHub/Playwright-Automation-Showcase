# ðŸš€ Playwright Automation Showcase with GitHub CI/CD
**[]()**
[Latest Test Results](https://pittsgithub.github.io/Playwright-Automation-Showcase/)

A project to showcase the playwright framework I've built testing against demo websites and API's

- Eslint with a playwright plugin primarily to make sure async is correct throughout
- Prettier to keep a consistent style of code
- Husky to make sure any commit is checked for consistent styling and syntax

My goal is to write SOLID, DRY (where possible with test code), and CLEAN test code to make 'Uncle Bob' smile. 
But more importantly, so that the code can be easily read and extended by other QA's
