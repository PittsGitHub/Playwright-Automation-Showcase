# ðŸš€ Playwright .ts Automation CI/CD Showcase
**[]()**
### Packages 
- Playwright for automating and carrying out testing
- Eslint with a playwright plugin primarily to make sure async is correct throughout
- Prettier to keep a consistent style of code
- Husky to make sure any commit is checked for consistent styling and syntax <br>

*I aim to write SOLID, DRY and CLEAN test code to make 'Uncle Bob' smile. 
But more importantly, so that the code can be easily read and extended by other QA's*<br>


### Sites Tested Against:
- https://qaplayground.dev/
- https://automationintesting.online/booking/<br>

### Latest Automated Tests:
*The tests are run automatically on push and pull requests*
